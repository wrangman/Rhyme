This is a simple game. Just type a full, valid word, 
with one syllable, that rhymes with 'light' (but no 
duplicates, nor names like dwight, brite, wright, or 
leyte).

You have five attempts every turn to choose a valid
rhyme.

- If you run out of attempts you lose,
- If you run out of rhymes you lose,
- If you know more words than me you win! 
- If you give up just hit ENTER.
