This is a simple game. Just type a full, valid word
- with one syllable - that rhymes with 'light' (but 
no duplicates, nor names like dwight, brite, wright, 
or leyte).

You have five attempts every turn to choose a valid
rhyme.

- If you run out of attempts you lose,
- If you run out of rhymes you lose,
- If you know more words than me you win! 
- If you give up just hit ENTER.
